# DomModifyUsingJS
This project is to basically practice DOM manipulation using javascript.
The app.js under assets/scrips folder runs when page is loaded and adds HTML elements using javascript.

There is lot of functionality I tested with this raw dummy webpage:

![raw_page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18566807/92305336-d9bd7000-efa3-11ea-997a-b4beba7dbd3a.PNG)

The webpage has a model which doesnot render when page is loaded, due to CSS being set on the respective div element. It hides the div. The tasks are as below:

1. On load make modal visible and change a class of modal
2. Add controls to backdrop
3. Read inputs and validate
4. Create record and clear input fields
5. Render UI
6. Delete entry
